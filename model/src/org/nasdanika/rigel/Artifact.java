 * Artifact is something output/produced by a source and consumed by a target as input. For example - source code, user guide, binary code. 
 * Artifacts are passed between activities over transitions.
 * Artifacts can be stored in artifact repositories and be used as resources. E.g. an executable jar file or Eclipse product can be produced as an artifact by a build activity and then be used as a tool.
 * Another example is documentation.
